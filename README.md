To implement a single-player snake game running in the browser, we will need to create the following files:

1. `public/index.html`: This file will contain the HTML structure of our game. It will include a game board and score display.
2. `public/main.js`: This file will contain the JavaScript logic for our game. It will handle the game mechanics such as snake movement, food generation, collision detection, and score calculation.
3. `public/style.css`: This file will contain the CSS styles for our game. It will style the game board, snake, food, and score display.
4. `server.js`: This file will serve our static files and start our server.
5. `package.json`: This file will contain the metadata about our project and its dependencies.

Let's start by creating our `public/index.html` file:

public/index.html
